## About The Project

This project is a line follower and maze solver robot that uses a PID algorithm to navigate through a black line on a white surface. The robot is also equipped with sensors to navigate through a printed maze on a white surface. In addition, the robot is provided with a mobile application that scans the top view of the line print and adjusts the robot's speed accordingly.

Our team, <em><b>Ninja</b></em>, developed this project as part of our Embedded Systems course at Faculty of Engineering, Cairo Univerity. We used an Arduino Uno board to control the robot's motors and sensors and programmed it using the Arduino IDE. The mobile application was developed using Python.


## Features
* Line following: The robot uses a PID algorithm to follow a black line on a white surface.
* Mobile application: The robot is provided with a mobile application that scans the top view of the line print and adjusts the robot's speed accordingly.
* Maze solving: The robot can navigate through a printed maze on a white surface using its sensors and PID algorithm.
